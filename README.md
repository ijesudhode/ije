I made this programming language because I wanted to. It works.

## ❓ What is this?
It's a programming language with its own custom keywords. You can write code in it. It has a compiler and an interpreter. It does the job.

## 💻 The Code
It looks like this:

```ije
// Just a simple function
kian hello()
    da("Hello world, i guess")
job

hello()
```

## 🛠️ How to use
1. **Download** `ije.exe` from Releases.
2. **Run** your code:
   ```bash
   ije file.ije
   ```
3. That's it. No complicated setup.

## ✨ Features
- **Custom Keywords**: Uses things like `kian`, `da`, `tha`.
- **It Runs**: Compiles and interprets your code (mostly).
- **IDE Support**: There's a VS Code extension if you really need it.
- **Package Manager**: Yeah, I added one of those too.

## 📥 Install
Download the binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ijesudhode/ije/releases).
